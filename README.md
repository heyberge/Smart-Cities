## Introduction 

In this lab, we worked on the thermal modelling of a building. We imagined the building and its thermal characteristics, then built its thermal network. We computed the matrices that were needed for the mathematical model, and then conducted two analyses : one in steady state and a dynamic one. Then we simulated the response to weather data and worked on the optimization of our model.
